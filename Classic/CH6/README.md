###Chapter 6 Graph Algorithm

####Definition
In the most common sense of the term, a [**graph**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) is an ordered pair G = (V, E) comprising a set V of vertices or nodes together with a set E of edges or links, which are 2-element subsets of V (i.e., an edge is related with two vertices, and the relation is represented as an unordered pair of the vertices with respect to the particular edge). To avoid ambiguity, this type of graph may be described precisely as undirected and simple.


####Algorithms
1. Dijkstra's algorithm
	
	Dijkstra's algorithm, conceived by computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956 and published in 1959,[1][2] is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge path costs, producing a shortest path tree. This algorithm is often used in routing and as a subroutine in other graph algorithms.
