###Contents
>This part aims at the basic data strcture and algorithm in the college. It covers most of the content in 
the book "Introduction to Algorithms". There exist many diffrent types of classifications for algorithms, 
such as complexity, deterministic vs randomized, paradigm (like divide-and-conquer, greedy etc) and so on.
I just follow the mainstream of the introduction book. Since the science and technology are evloving 
everyday, two new chapters are added, which I think should be useful to everyone.
