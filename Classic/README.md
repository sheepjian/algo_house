>This part aims at the basic data strcture and algorithm in the college. It covers most of the content in 
the book "Introduction to Algorithms". There exist many diffrent types of classifications for algorithms, 
such as complexity, deterministic vs randomized, paradigm (like divide-and-conquer, greedy etc.) and so on.
I just follow the mainstream in the book. Since the science and technology is evloving everyday, two new chapters are added, which I think should be known to everyone.  

ch1. Sorting 
ch2. Elementary Data Structure
ch3. Dynamic Programming
ch4. Greedy Algorithms
ch5. Adavance Data Structure
ch6. Graph Algorithms
ch7. Numerical Algorithms
ch8. Machine Learning Algorithms
