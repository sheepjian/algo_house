####Questions


1. *Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem*
   - Q: Given two sequences, print the longest subsequence present in both of them.
   - Example:   
         LCS for input "ABCDGH" and "AEDFHR" is "ADH" of length 3   
         LCS for input "AGGTAB" and  "GXTXAYB" is "GTAB" of length 4  
   - A: see ./code/ch3.1.cpp
