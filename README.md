#Algorithm House 
>Since I started to write code, I have met many tough and interested geek problems both in mathemtaic and
computer science fields. I would like to write down the solutions for each algorithm problem I ever met,
it may be a diary for a scientist/engineer/programmer to recall when getting old. How silly I could be 
then. Problem-oriented-learning always gives you much firsthand and visible understanding.
